# Credit-Risk-Scoring
This project focuses on building a Credit Risk Scoring model using XGBoost to predict the probability of loan default. The dataset is preprocessed through data cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.

The model is trained and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure reliable risk prediction.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of machine learning for financial risk assessment and showcases skills in data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and performance optimization.
